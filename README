1. You couldn't add a main method to Region because it had unimplemented abstract methods in it. They didn't actually do anything yet, and therefore couldn't be tested.

2. Yes we could have. ContainerRegions could have been modified to accept generics. However, we would have to check to make sure that whatever was submitted was a region of some sort.

3. I had trouble with the ContainerRegions. The array of regions always threw a null pointer exception, even though there was a correct pointer. I just googled around until I found a solution. I should be set with it now.

4. I learnt a little more about abstract classes and how they work.

5. A little more instruction would be handy. There were times where I was unsure how to proceed.

6. I worked with two others, and we would talk everything out beforehand, correcting each other and offering up ideas before actually coding anything.
